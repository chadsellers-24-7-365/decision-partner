# Decision Partner

AI that helps you think — not thinks for you.

---

## How it works

Four agents. One rule: no agent tells you what to choose.

```
Clarify → Explore → Challenge → Synthesize
```

1. **Clarify** — Surface what you're really deciding
2. **Explore** — Find options you haven't considered
3. **Challenge** — Test your assumptions
4. **Synthesize** — Compile insights, end with a question

---

## The philosophy

Most AI answers questions as fast as possible.

Some questions shouldn't be answered quickly. They should be explored.

**The pipeline is the product.**

---

## Use it for

- Career decisions
- Relationship crossroads
- Life transitions
- Business choices
- Hard conversations

The more context you share, the better it works.
