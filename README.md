## What is this?

Decision Partner is a **multi-agent AI system** that guides you through complex decisions using 4 specialized thinking agents. 

Unlike typical AI that rushes to give you an answer, Decision Partner helps you find your own clarity.

### The 4 Agents

| Agent | Role | Key Question |
|-------|------|--------------|
| 🔍 **Clarifier** | Surfaces the REAL decision | "What are you actually deciding?" |
| 🌎 **Explorer** | Expands your options | "What haven't you considered?" |
| ⚡ **Challenger** | Tests assumptions | "What if the opposite were true?" |
| 🎯 **Synthesizer** | Compiles insights | "What's become clearer?" |

**The Synthesizer never tells you what to choose.** It ends with a reflective question, not a recommendation.

## The Philosophy

> "AI's highest value isn't in doing your thinking for you — it's in helping you think more clearly."

Most AI is designed to answer questions as fast as possible. But some questions shouldn't be answered quickly — they should be **explored**.

**The pipeline is the product.**

```
Clarify → Explore → Challenge → Synthesize
```

Each step builds on the last. By the end, you're not waiting for an answer. You've found clarity.
